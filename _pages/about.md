Hey there! 

In 2021, I completed my Master's in Data Science at NYU Center of Data Science. During my time there, I had the amazing opportunity to work with GeneCentrix Inc. on detecting hidden drug-target interactions within text sources for cheminformatics applications. Before my Master's, I studied Computer Engineering and Mathematics at NYU Tandon School of Engineering.

During my coursework, I became interested in Natural Language Processing and Recommender Systems. Recently, I've became interested in Anomoly Detection applications for Data Engineering purposes.

Currently, I'm seeking employment in Data Science or Machine Learning Engineering roles. Connect with me on LinkedIn or send me an email at raymohabir1@gmail.com.
